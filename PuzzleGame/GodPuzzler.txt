GodPuzzler.co.uk:

Randomly generates in an array association a section of a puzzle in a 3x3 Grid, 16 total pieces, of a picture of a god.
Uses similar naming process to the osrs the clue generator.

Each piece, when clicked on, changes, and changes that value of in the array, based on another random generation.
There is a button that checks the value in the array (Complete) that either tells the user they are correct or they are
wrong, if they are correct/wrong they get a separate animation, and a time.

The seleced god/picture is then removed from the rotation/array, and then the process starts all over again. When the
last god is finished, you get a final you win screen.
