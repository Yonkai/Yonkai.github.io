            Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.

            <!-- Something that I noticed here is that when I put the paragraph before the image on the right,
                 and typed so that the paragraph text reached the image, it pushes the image out of they way,
                 but if I put it after the image, the text wraps around the image, Why is this? Is this part of some
                 bigger propety I'm not aware of? Need to investigate further. -->
